# CST 326 Final Project
This is a game about being an asteroid wanting to obliterate other asteroids ... but be careful because you aren't powerful enough to run into too many planets!
# Instructions
Use A and D to move back and forth, run into asteroids to gain score and avoid planets. Spawn time between waves is lessened as game goes on. Try and bounce off the walls for some more advanced moves. 
Hit 3 planets and it's game over!
